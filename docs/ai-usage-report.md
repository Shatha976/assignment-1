# AI Usage Report – Shatha Alharbi Portfolio

## Introduction
During the development of my Assignment-1 portfolio website, I incorporated AI tools to support the design, coding, and debugging process. Rather than replacing my own work, these tools acted as assistants, helping me test ideas, refine layouts, and solve issues faster. This report explains how the tools were applied, the advantages and difficulties I experienced, what I learned, and the way I adapted the generated suggestions responsibly.

## Tools used & use cases

### ChatGPT
- **Main Role:** Helped with code corrections and HTML/CSS adjustments.  
- **Use Uses:**  
  - Pointed out syntax mistakes in my JavaScript and suggested fixes for event listener errors.  
  - Recommended accessibility-friendly HTML tags and attributes to improve usability.  
  - Offered alternative approaches for simple form validation and limiting user input length.  

### Claude
- **Main Role:** Assisted with front-end design and page structure.  
- **Use Uses:**  
  - Suggested responsive layouts using Flexbox to organize sections consistently.  
  - Proposed ideas for hover animations and transitions to make the portfolio more dynamic.  
  - Guided me in adjusting spacing, alignment, and color balance for a cleaner look.

## Challenges 
- **Extra Code:** At times, the suggestions included unnecessary or repetitive styles that I had to simplify.  
- **Occasional Misalignment:** Some recommendations didn’t fully match the project’s requirements or design goals and had to be reworked.  
- **Complex Explanations:** Some responses were too advanced for my level, so I had to break them down carefully before applying them.

## Learning outcomes
- **Debugging Strategies:** I became more confident in checking small details like missing attributes or misnamed variables.  
- **Stronger Front-End Skills:** Practiced building layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and improved visual consistency.  
- **Critical Evaluation:** Learned not to rely blindly on AI outputs, but instead review and edit them to match my goals.  
- **Responsible Adaptation:** Instead of copying suggestions, I simplified and reshaped them to fit my style and understanding, making sure the final work was genuinely mine.

## Final Reflection
AI tools acted like a guide during the portfolio project, helping me spot mistakes faster and experiment with design improvements. While their input was valuable, the final decisions, edits, and implementations were my responsibility. This experience showed me that AI is best used as a supportive partner — speeding up work and offering inspiration, but always requiring critical thinking and human judgment to produce a meaningful result.
